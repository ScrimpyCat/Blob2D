Blob2D
======

Blob2D is a 2D game engine library written in C and the blob language. It extends upon the functionality provided in [CommonGameKit](https://github.com/ScrimpyCat/CommonGameKit). Usage of the engine will typically be done through writing [blob scripts](https://github.com/ScrimpyCat/CommonGameKit/blob/master/src/scripting/README.md) but can also be done in C.

This engine is mostly for my own internal usage for creating my own games, so some design patterns and choices that were made may appear quite odd. In general if you found this project whilst searching for a game engine, you will want to keep searching.
